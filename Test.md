:pushpin: We need to alter the file structure and ensure that all the files are in the same hierarchy. As per email from Thomas, the top-down and bottom-up approach is not valid anymore. Once the file hierarchy is set, we will have to add the cross-references to the selected template.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

The SDAccel tutorials are designed to work with Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs. The tutorials have been verified on `provide details of boards tested or recommended` boards. Xilinx [SDSoC 2018.2 Development Environment](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/sdx-development-environments.html) is required to work with the tutorials.


## How to Download the Repository

To get a local copy of the SDSoC tutorials, clone this repository to the local system with the following command:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Tutorials.git SDAccel_Tutorials
```
Where `SDAccel_Tutorials` is the name of the directory where the repository will be stored on the local system. This command needs to be executed only once to retrieve the latest version of the SDAccel tutorials.
